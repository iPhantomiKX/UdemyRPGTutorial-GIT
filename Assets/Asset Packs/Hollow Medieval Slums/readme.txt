Hollow - Medieval Slums Level Pack

Create high quality medieval slums using this level pack. Great for role playing games but not limited to that game type. All the art assets follows current generation graphic techniques and each assets contain custom 2nd UV channel for light map support. 

This level package contains:
- 78 Models in .FBX format
- 52 Textures in .TGA format (Most textures are 512x512)
- Specular map and normal map included

Tips:
- I recommend that you start off  with floor plan first then add the buildings then finish it off with the props.
- Most of the asset are modulated so all the assets should fit together nicely.  Vertex snap hotkey is your best friend (hotkey : V)
- Try not to modulated the assets to much. To get the best result from this package is blending both modulate and freeform object placing. 
- I highly recommend using  Unity3D built in light map tool. This level pack works great with light map and can create amazing results.
